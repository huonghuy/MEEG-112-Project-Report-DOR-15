Our team believed that a hat based on Doris, from the movie "Meet the Robinsons", would be a fun way to make a drone that would sell well in the holiday season. Some rough concept sketches were created, and from there we started designing. The project changed from the original design sketch, but the core concept remained. \par

In the future, our group would like to add a camera on the front of the drone, as currently the "eye" serves no function. Another enhancement would be a better system for the propellers. The current propeller configuration only allows for a very limited range of motion. An interesting direction that was discussed and is a potential future project would be to lean more heavily on the hat component and design a drone that interfaces with different types of hats to create a drone that can turn any hat into a flying hat. \par

Due to the limited time and lack of know-how, we were unable to design the internal circuitry for the drone. So, if there were more time and information on circuitry and drone motors, we would have been able to design the internal circuitry for the drone. \par
