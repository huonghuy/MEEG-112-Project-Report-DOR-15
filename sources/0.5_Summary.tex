The DOR-15 Drone project, inspired by the hat-shaped drone from \textit{Meet the Robinsons}, sought to create a unique holiday toy for all to enjoy. Our design blended the playful charm of a bowler hat with the functionality of a modern drone, powered by three propellers for six degrees of movement. Throughout the project, we faced challenges in precise component sizing and assembly. To address these issues, we refined the CAD model, ensuring compatibility and durability. The final design incorporated force-fit dowels for propeller stability and a protective parts cover. Future plans include integrating a camera module to enhance the droneâ€™s functionality.

This project offered invaluable experience in collaborative engineering, problem-solving, and CAD modeling. By overcoming real-world design constraints, our team successfully transformed a creative concept into a practical, manufacturable product. The process reinforced our understanding of engineering principles while showcasing the potential for innovative designs to captivate both children and adults.
