%Introduction Pragraph
In this project, we will be compiling and utilizing all of our gathered knowledge on part making and use of Solid works to design and assemble a drone which in our case will be DOR-15 or otherwise known as DORIS.  This project is set up so that as a team we can help add to the design and complexity via basing it off of our concept sketch.  Using solid works we will then create a part, detailed drawing and then finally assemble.  To top off this project, we will be writing a report as well as filming a 5 minute video about the process and the part itself.\par
