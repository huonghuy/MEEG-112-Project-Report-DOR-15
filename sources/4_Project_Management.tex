%Include a project management plan with all major milestones, tasks, and personnel assigned.


    Some upcoming tasks that we have planned are our assembly of our drone in Solidworks and drawing creation. We plan to achieve this following the thanksgiving break on 11/28. We want to make sure all our drone parts are done and completed prior to the final deadline to give our team plenty of time to resolve issues before finals. All main components have been completed and modeled.
