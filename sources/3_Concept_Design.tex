%Introduction Pragraph

%How did you generate your preliminary design ideas? Why do you choose the current design. Do you have some other preliminary designs that can be compared with to show the superiority of your current design?

To generate our preliminary design, we simply thought of an initial idea, implicated a change to the initial design that we thought was feasibly possible. Then, with some modifications, we came across the first roadblock of accurately sizing every individual piece so that they could mesh together to create a functioning body. We used the insight to first create our own individual parts to the specific sizes we intended, and then during the assembly phase of the project, we encountered the struggle of the differing sizes in our own vision, which in turn caused heavy modifications for the drone to not only function but to even be plausible. After various trials during assembly, we came across our final design, which we stuck through till the end so we could make the best and most functioning drone we could come up with. 

\subsection{Product Specifications}
% Give a full introduction of your design

\subsection{Details of the Design}
%Include a picture of the entire assembled model here. Explain your design. All other CAD models should be placed in the appropriate appendix.

\subsection{Tolerance and Fit}
%Point out the tolerance and fit of the connecting parts. You should give reasonable tolerance for the parts and fit for the connections. At the same time give an explanation of why. Show tolerance and fit in the CAD drawing. Explain everything in your Presentation
