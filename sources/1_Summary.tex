\textbf{Summary}
\end{center}
Our drone design is based of the robot DOR-15, affectionately named DORIS in the 2007 movie, \textit{Disney's Meet the Robinsons}. DORIS, is a futuristic hat controlled via artificial intelligence that can do many things but inevitably enslaves the human race for its own nefarious duties. Our drone takes inspiration in DORIS' form factor and will be also hat shaped. This makes it fun for children on the holiday season, similar to that of a top hat or propeller hat. Each team member is confident that our project will be completed in time as we divide and collaborate on each task evenly. In the rest of this report, you will find our estimated timeline as well as assigned roles and duties per team member.\par
