For this project, we were tasked with creating a functioning drone to be a kid's toy. As a group, we took on the task with the planning to bring forth our version of a drone-like device that appeared in Meet the Robinsons. This device is known as DOR-15 and is depicted as a sentient hat that accompanies a time traveler and can apparently levitate. Seeing how levitation is not something we are currently equipped to re-create we went along and designed a concept sketch which highlights propellers. This project can show the development of something that we may see as simple and shows us the challenges of bringing an idea we have to life. By showing the many steps this process takes to get right, we have learned a lot and have grown as CAD designers, hoping to further improve upon our ideas and turn them all into reality. \par
