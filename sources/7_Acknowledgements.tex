%Acknowledge those that helped you, outside of your group members, with the project. This should include the professors, TAâ€™s, lab technicians, and any other outside personnel.

Our group would like to thank Cornelius Robinson for initially coming up with the idea for DORIS and giving us the inspiration for pursuing this project. Without his work, we would have been very lost.

We would also like to thank Dr. Joyce Hu and the MEEG-112 TA for their help and guidance throughout this project. Without their help, we would have fallen behind in our planned schedule.
